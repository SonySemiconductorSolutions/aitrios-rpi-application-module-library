# Raspberry Pi AI Camera

Compatible with all Raspberry Pi computers as host, the [Raspberry Pi AI Camera](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/ai-camera/) takes advantage of Sony’s IMX500 Intelligent Vision Sensor to help you create impressive vision AI applications and neural network models using the on-module AI processor.

## Installation

### 1) Hardware setup

We expect the Raspberry Pi computer to be installed correclty with the AiCamera connected and access to the board terminal. For a detailed description on how to install a Raspberry Pi Camera see [this](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html#install-a-raspberry-pi-camera) link.

### 2) Install IMX500 Firmware

Ensure that your Raspberry Pi runs the latest software:

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
sudo apt install imx500-all
```

**This command:**
- installs the /lib/firmware/imx500_loader.fpk and /lib/firmware/imx500_firmware.fpk firmware files required to operate the IMX500 sensor
- places a number of neural network model firmware files in /usr/share/imx500-models/
- installs the Sony network model packaging tools

Now that you’ve installed the prerequisites, restart your Raspberry Pi:
```shell
sudo reboot
```

### 3) Verify your setup

If you haven't already done so, make sure to install modlib (in your virtual environment).
(Optional) Create and enable a virtual environment.
**Required Python version: 3.11**

```shell
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

One can use pip to install the library in your project Python environment.
```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/SonySemiconductorSolutions/aitrios-rpi-application-module-library.git
```

:::warning  
We are currently working on publishing modlib to the PyPI index. This will make it easier for developers to install and manage the library using pip and allow for a more streamlined setup process. Stay tuned for updates!
:::

Let's verify that our camera is connected and the Application Module Library is installed correctly.  
Create a new Python file named `hello_world.py`. and run the following code to see a camera preview.

```python title="hello_world.py"
from modlib.devices import AiCamera

device = AiCamera()

with device as stream:
    for frame in stream:
        frame.display()
```
